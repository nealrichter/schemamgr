DBAudit is a simple tool to manage schema change in MySQL DBs.  

Each change is assinged a version number and place in a file.  When the SQL 
in the file is executed sucessfully, 
a special table is set with that version number.

Edit the file and replace the occurances of X with your database-name.  The 
current/lazy best practice for this tool is to make a derivative copy for 
each database-name.

It is necessary to install the version tracking table with build/install_config_table.sql

Example upgrade steps with version naming conventions are in the build directory.
