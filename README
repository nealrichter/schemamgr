SchemaMgr is a simple tool to manage schema change in MySQL DBs.  

Each change is assigned a version number and place in a file.  When the SQL 
in the file is executed sucessfully, a special table is set with that version 
number.

It can also be used to reinstall views and stored procedures.

INSTALLATION

1) Edit the file and replace the occurances of X with your database-name.  The 
current/lazy best practice for this tool is to make a derivative copy for 
each database-name and customize to it's needs.

2) It is necessary to install the version tracking table with build/install_config_table.sql

Example upgrade steps with version naming conventions are in the build directory.

$ ./bin/schemamgr_X.pl 
Usage: either create or upgrade X database
	schemamgr_X.pl -i -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD [-vVERSION] [-b]
		 updates DB of to current (default) or requested version
	schemamgr_X.pl -s -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD
		 reinstalls all stored procedures
	schemamgr_X.pl -w -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD 
		 reinstalls all views
	schemamgr_X.pl -q -uUSERNAME -pPASSWORD 
		 Requests and prints current version
Optional Params 
	 -vXX -- upgrades upto a specific version number XX 
	 -b   -- backs up the database (with data) before upgrades 
	 -nYY -- runs the upgrades against database YY - default is X
